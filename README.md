A USC Data Analytics Bootcamp Project.

## Abstract

We analyze data on wide-distribution movie releases in the January
2016 -- July 2018 time frame. We employ data from Box Office Mojo,
Rotten Tomatoes, and Twitter. Our focus is on factors that may affect
the opening-weekend box office gross numbers. We consider Rotten
Tomatoes critics and audience scores, the release season (and month),
and Twitter sentiment. We find that there is a significant, albeit
moderate-strength correlation between scores and box office
gross. There is a clear trend showing that movies released in the
summer and in the holiday season fair best in the box office while
movies released in the fall do worst. However, the variations we find
are not statistically significant. Finally, analyzing Twitter
sentiment for five recent movies, we do not find a correlation between
compound sentiment and opening weekend box office gross. However, the
amount of tweets analyzed was small and the set of movies analyzed was
very limited. A future more thorough analysis of the impact of Twitter
sentiment is called for.
